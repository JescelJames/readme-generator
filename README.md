# My Third Challenge: Create a Random Password Generator

## Description

### This is my first JavaScript challenge: To provide the user with random password.

- Challenge Link: https://jesceljames.github.io/js-password-generator/

- My motivation:  To build a password generator that requires input from user such as amount of characters (must be from 8 - 128 characters) using lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols. 
- Why I took this challege: This is my first JavaScript challenge that required functions, ifs, while loop, prompt, confirm, getElementById, addEventListener, parseInit, math.floor, and math.random.
- What the challenge solved:  The user can create a random password based on having the ability to select the length and type(letters, numbers, symbols) of characters.


### What I learned:  

1. That getElementById links to an id in HTML.
2. That it's easier to code and cleaner if I divide the codes to sections: DEPENDENCIES, DATA, FUNCTIONS, USER INTERACTIONS, AND INITIALIZATION. 
3. That functions is difficult to understand, but once I grasp the concept, the code seem to flow better.
4. That the foor..loop can make me pull my hair out if my expression #2 is not called properly.  The console does not provide any error for this...
5. That DOM is another beast of itself I need to do a lot more reading and experience.  
6. That return in function provides value.
7. That math.floor and math.random seem to go together when creating a random password generator based on my research.
8. That eventListener can be used for clicks, double clicks
9. That parseInt helps to identify string value and return to integer, using radix parameter 10. 
10. console.log can be a quick way to check if button's event listener is working.


## Code Description

The HTML and CSS in this code was prebuilt.  I made most of my updates and changes in the .js file.

#### My Instructors:
- Ben Wright (Who taught how to structure the code in 5 ways: Dependencies, Data, Functions, User Interactions, and Initializations.  This appraoch helps tremendously!)
- Max Ohsawa (Who helped me understand functions. Such an easy person to talk to and listen.)
- Erik Sayer (Who guided me how to find what is missing with my code to make it work. He did not tell me the answer, he showed me the way.  I like his approach.)
