# My Fourth Challenge: Create a Readme Generator

## Description
This challenge helps the user create a high quality README.md file using command prompt.  The file created README.md will be changed to the project title's name. For example, the title of your project is Spartan Project, the file name of the project will be SPARTANPROJECT.md.


### This is my first Node js challenge: To help the user generate a Readme for a project.

- My motivation:  To build a readme generator with user input from terminal.
- Why I took this challege: To learn to create a file using prompts from terminal.
- What the challenge solved:  The user can create a high quality readme.md file from prompts from terminal.  


### What I learned:  

1. Make sure that branch is consistently add, commit, push on a branch.  
2. Before exiting a branch, use git status to see if all has been add, commit, and pushed. 
3. Be aware of what branch i'm working on.  I made multiple mistake working on the main branch.
4. That arrow function can be quite confusing at first, but you get to get used to it.
5. That const and let offer better flexibility
6. That functional loops such as forEach, and map can grab data in different ways
7. That template literals offer powerful way to put elements together.
8. That process.argv grabs the data starting at index[2].
9. That file system fs, is a module inside nodejs. Needs require method to pull it. Can use fs.readFile, fs.appendFile, and fs.writeFile 
10. That ternary operator syntax:  condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse  e.g. (err) => err ? console.error(err) : console.log('Commit logged!')
11. That module.exports from one file need require method from another file to grab the data.  It's important to have ./ for local file. 
12. Read the documents in npmjs.com helps tremendously.
13. That .gitignore with node_modules ignore in node_modules folder.
14. That package.json is object with properties.


## Code Description

This code can be accessed in terminal by running index.js file. type: node index.js in terminal and prompts will appear to create a readme file.
